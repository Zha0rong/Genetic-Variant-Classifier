# Genetic-Variant-Classifier

_An Naive Bayes Classifier based on [ClinVar Database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)._

# Introduction

What is ClinVar?

> *[ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)* is a freely accessible, public archive of reports of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes, with supporting evidence.

Using a large database like ClinVar as training data set, this project provides a Naive Bayes Classifier to help researchers to predict whether a _genetic variant_ is _pathogenic_ or _benign_.




# i am currently occupied by final exams and report, i will just put the ROC curve for classification algorithm here for those who are interested in the performance.
